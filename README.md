Findit is a program we're making to help hospital folks find medical items in hazardous storage rooms. 

To run this repository, you will need :
- Bun.sh

TODO :
- change PWA title from 'findit' to 'Findit'
- change PWA icon from default to the emoji (see Google Drive)
- UI for mobile-first: bottom row buttons, narrrow UI
- items can be queried
- add photo upload, add photo to DB
- add creator username for every item
- manage Row Level Security on supabase
- export items.csv from google sheets, normalize and add to supabase
- add Terraform or pulumi to manage database from code
